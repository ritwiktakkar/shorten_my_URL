# Description

Shortening URLs helps to manage them for both large-scale projects and everyday tasks. Shorter URLs save valuable space in your spreadsheets by fitting in smaller cells. They also look better than their full-length versions. Use ShortenMyURL to shorten URLs in no time on your iPhone and iPad.
